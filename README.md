   ‚Ä¢	Date & Time: Tracks trends and peak hours.
   ‚Ä¢	Booking/Order ID: Unique alphanumeric ID (e.g., ABC1234567).
   ‚Ä¢	Booking/Order Status: Successful, Cancelled (Customer/Driver), or Incomplete.
   ‚Ä¢	Type: (e.g., Product, Service Type, Category.)
   ‚Ä¢	Locations: Randomized across n prominent areas/regions.
   ‚Ä¢	Cancellation Reasons: Detailed reasons for both parties.
   ‚Ä¢	Metrics: TAT, quantity, distance, value, etc.
   ‚Ä¢	Payment Methods & Segmentations: Categorized for further insights.


üõ† Tools & Technologies
   ‚Ä¢	SQL: Data wrangling, cleaning, and querying for insights.
   ‚Ä¢	Power BI: Dashboard creation and detailed reporting.
   ‚Ä¢	Python/Excel: Data preprocessing and randomization.


‚ú® Key Features
   ‚Ä¢	Maintained xx% success rate for [core metric/bookings].
   ‚Ä¢	Cancellation Rates:
   ‚Ä¢	Customer cancellations: <X%
   ‚Ä¢	Driver cancellations: <X%
   ‚Ä¢	Simulated real-world demand, including peaks on weekends or key periods.
