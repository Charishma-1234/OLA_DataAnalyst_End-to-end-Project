   ‚Ä¢	Date & Time: Tracks trends and peak hours.
   ‚Ä¢	Booking/Order ID: Unique alphanumeric ID (e.g., ABC1234567).
   ‚Ä¢	Booking/Order Status: Successful, Cancelled (Customer/Driver), or Incomplete.
   ‚Ä¢	Type: (e.g., Product, Service Type, Category.)
   ‚Ä¢	Locations: Randomized across n prominent areas/regions.
   ‚Ä¢	Cancellation Reasons: Detailed reasons for both parties.
   ‚Ä¢	Metrics: TAT, quantity, distance, value, etc.
   ‚Ä¢	Payment Methods & Segmentations: Categorized for further insights.


üõ† Tools & Technologies
